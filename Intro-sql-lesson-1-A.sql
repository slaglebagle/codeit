/* Welcome to Code It "Learn Coding" *\

/* In this section we are going to take a look at, what is a database? Why do we do we uses databases? and how database function.
Generally you don't need to know a lot about coding, but you will need to pay close attention to this course because when we
start learning about SQL statements and syntax it can be very tedious at time and I want to make sure you have a general
understanding of databases. So just relax and slowly read the lessons and feel free to make necessary post on the forums if you
get stuck. Generally I will reply back within a few hours after you post something so please don't expect me to reply right away
. My contact information will also be listed, but it would be better if you posted on the forum because I can easily understand
what you are doing and help you resolve your problem a lot faster. Enjoy this course! :) */
